### 1:1 Meetings
Purpose
1. create human connection between you and manager
    - serve as context to the manager, and allow manager to notice your mood/energy level
    - this is to build trust, and trust requires the you to be vulnerable against each other
2. allow you to discuss matters privately
    - if possible, plan ahead, come up with topics

1:1s are **not supposed** to be a status meeting
